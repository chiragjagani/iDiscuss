# iDiscuss - Forum Website

Welcome to iDiscuss! This project was my first significant endeavor in my journey as a web developer. iDiscuss is a forum website similar to Stack Overflow, where users can post questions and provide answers. The site features various categories like PHP, Java, etc., a blog section, and a working search bar. Users must be logged in to post questions and answers.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users must sign up and log in to post questions and answers.
- **Categories**: Different categories such as PHP, Java, etc., to organize discussions.
- **Blogs**: A dedicated section for reading and sharing blogs.
- **Search Bar**: A functional search bar to find questions, answers, and blogs.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly design to provide a seamless experience on any device.
